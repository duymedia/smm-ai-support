# Open-Design Mandatory Frontend Standards (nexu-io/open-design)

All frontend design and implementation in this project MUST strictly follow the Open-Design system:

1. **Design System & Aesthetics**:
   - Reference archetypes: Linear App, Cloudflare Console, Stripe, Trading Terminal.
   - Dot-matrix subtle canvas texture: `bg-[radial-gradient(circle,rgba(15,23,42,0.06)_1px,transparent_1px)] [background-size:28px_28px]`.
   - Glassmorphic card surfaces: `rounded-2xl border border-slate-200/80 bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-sm shadow-[0_18px_40px_-28px_rgba(15,23,42,0.10)]`.
   - Mac window header chrome for telemetry/fleet engine modules.

2. **Typography & Numbers**:
   - UI typography: Clean sentence-case Sans (`Inter` / system-ui).
   - Financial & Telemetry: Monospace tabular numbers (`font-mono tabular-nums`) for currency, rates, IDs, and latency.

3. **Buttons & Controls**:
   - Primary and secondary buttons MUST use `rounded-full` (Pill buttons) with minimum height >= 40px.
   - Status indicators MUST use pill badges (`rounded-full`) with live pulsing LED dots.

4. **Strict Anti-Cliché Rules**:
   - NO generic SaaS AI template cards with 32px borders.
   - NO decorative purple gradients or blurry blobs.
   - NO div soup; use semantic HTML elements.
   - All interactive elements MUST have visible keyboard focus (`focus-visible:ring-2`).
